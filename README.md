# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

!!!This new portfolio is currently under development!!!

## What Will This Repo Do?

The intention of this Repo is to replace my old Portfolio

### `Why?`

My old Portfolio has alot of issues associated with it. Chief of those issues being a lack of text file to contain all readable text, lack of framework and extremely poor css organisation.

Creating a new portfolio also gives a good opportunity to learn a new frame work. in this case with React.
